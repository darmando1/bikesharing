# Bike Sharing

## Project Overview
The purpose of the analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing idea could work in Des Moines, Iowa based on data identified in the NYC Citi Bike Dataset. Assuming Des Moines, Iowa shares similar conditions as NYC, the project will help identify the target demographics and users of bikes.

## Analysis
### Checkout Times

![Checkout Times](https://github.com/darmando1/bikesharing/blob/main/Challenge/Supporting%20Images/Checkout%20Times%20for%20Users.JPG)
For ALL users, checkout time is generally less than an hour. This implies that most users can either A. Arrive at their destination within one hour or B. Complete a workout within an hour. From the visual it appears that most users complete their trips within approximately 10 - 20 minutes. As 10 - 20 minutes for a bike ride seems generally short, it may be implied that MOST users utilize the bike as a form of transportation versus utilizing them for workouts.

![Checkout Times by Gender](https://github.com/darmando1/bikesharing/blob/main/Challenge/Supporting%20Images/Checkout%20Times%20for%20Users%20by%20Gender.JPG)
It appears that the users are predominantly male. This may imply that females may be uncomfortable utilizing bike-sharing and may prefer other alternative methods of transportation. The similar shape of the male line versus the female line shows that although less females utilize the bike-sharking program the females that do use the program generally use them for the same amount of time as men.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour
![Trips by Weekday per Hour](https://github.com/darmando1/bikesharing/blob/main/Challenge/Supporting%20Images/Trips%20by%20Weekday%20per%20Hour.JPG)
A significant amount of usage occurs during the weekend from the hours of 9 AM to 7PM may imply that generally speaking these users are NOT commuting to and from work. Similarly, the fact that between the traditional working hours of 10 AM to 3PM on workdays, the ride-share usage significantly decreases. Between the traditional commuting hours of 6AM to 9AM on the workdays we see an increase in usage along with the hours of 4PM to 7PM. Thus, during the workdays it may be safe to assume that most users utilize this program to commute to and from work. During the weekends the users appear to be spread out more and appear to utilize the bike-sharing program for leisure.

![Trips by Gender](https://github.com/darmando1/bikesharing/blob/main/Challenge/Supporting%20Images/Trips%20by%20Weekday%20by%20Gender.JPG)
The same assumptions can be made above as it appears that females and males predominantly utilize the bike-sharing program for work during workdays and potential leisure during the weekend.

### User Trips by Usertype
![User Trips by Usertype](https://github.com/darmando1/bikesharing/blob/main/Challenge/Supporting%20Images/User%20Trips%20by%20Gender.JPG)
A majority of the users are subscribers meaning a significant amount of income comes from consistent membership. One can infer that potential customers who utilize the bike-sharing program more than a few times are more willing to subscribe to mitigate continuous costs from one-off rentals. There appears to be once again similarities between MAle and Female usage by day.

### Number of Trips by Hour

As identified in the Trips by Weekday per hour, there seems to be an obvious pattern of higher usage on the workdays between 6AM to 9AM and 4PM to 6PM. During the weekends there is a flatter curve between 8AM to 9PM.

### Trip Duration by Gender and Location
![Trip Duration by Gender and Location](https://github.com/darmando1/bikesharing/blob/main/Challenge/Supporting%20Images/Trip%20Duration%20by%20Gender%20and%20Location.JPG)
All evidence points to significant concentration occurring within the Manhattan area and general Astoria/Brooklyn locations. It appears that many bike-sharing customers outside of Manhattan congregate around bridges with easy access to Manhattan.

## Summary
Several conclusions can be made based on the above data points:
  - There appears to be no significant difference between Male usage preference times and Female usage preference times.
  - There appears to be no significant difference between weekday usage between Males and Females.
  - Subscribers account for the majority of users.
  - Trip location is generally congregated within the Manhattan area and areas with ease of access to Manhattan.

Some possible future visualizations may include:
  - A visualization to graph where users prefer to start/end their trips. Are these areas easily accessible by metro or other means of transportation?
  - A visualization to graph where Males prefer to start/end their trips vs Females. Are females generally less likely to go to certain areas?
